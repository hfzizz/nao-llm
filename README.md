# nao-llm
This project focuses on integrating a fine-tuned model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for a Large Language Model (LLM) to enable communication with the NAO Robot. The integration allows the robot to respond, interpret commands, perform actions based on emotional context, and understand Malay language.
